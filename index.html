  <!-- This was a good project. I learned more about CSS. The JS was very little but the function played a major role.
I learned that I have to pay attention to evey single detail. The issue I had was I has added a ending div after all my h3s. My classes werent full in the container. Once I deleted all the extra divs. The program worked just fine. -->
